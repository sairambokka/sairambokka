üí° Projects
Malware Reverse Engineering | Software Reverse Engineering (November 2024)
Reverse-engineered a malware sample using Ghidra, identifying its Command & Control (C2) server and analyzing its network communication protocol, socket connections, and message structures to understand attacker tactics.

Examined malware functionality, including file operations, remote command execution, directory changes, and metadata exfiltration, uncovering how the malware manipulates system files and interacts with the compromised host.

Compiled findings into a detailed technical report, mapping behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK, categorizing attack techniques, and recommending mitigation strategies such as network segmentation, behavior-based detection, and endpoint hardening.

Endpoint Detection and Response using Deep Learning Model | Deep Learning (May 2024)
Engineered a custom deep learning model for Endpoint Detection and Response using Python and TensorFlow.

The model achieved an average accuracy of 0.89, precision of 0.86, recall of 0.91, and F1-score of 0.88, demonstrating robust performance in detecting and responding to potential security threats at network endpoints.

Enterprise Security Lab: Active Directory, Splunk, Atomic Red Team (August 2024)
Deployed Active Directory on Windows Server 2022 with organizational units and user policies; configured Splunk with Sysmon and Universal Forwarders on Ubuntu to improve Windows endpoint visibility.

Conducted adversary simulation using Atomic Red Team aligned with MITRE ATT&CK techniques, validated log visibility and detection coverage on Windows endpoints.

Network Penetration Testing | Cyber Practitioner Development Lab (May 2024)
Executed comprehensive penetration tests on 4 vulnerable machines. Identified and exploited high-risk vulnerabilities using Nmap for network discovery and Nessus for vulnerability scanning and mapped vulnerabilities to corresponding CVEs.

Successfully breached target systems by exploiting weak passwords, outdated software versions, and open ports.

Crafted custom malicious payloads based on vulnerability information to gain access to the systems.

Produced a detailed technical report outlining vulnerabilities, exploits and remediation strategies.

Risk Assessment of an Investment Firm | Risk Analysis and Compliance (December 2023)
Conducted risk assessment of an investment firm's security policies and controls against New York DFS regulations.

Identified deficiencies and created a thorough risk register detailing 12 findings, recommended solutions, and performed cost-benefit analyses for each remediation strategy, prioritizing actions based on risk severity and implementation costs.

Provided analysis of the results and risk treatment roadmap prioritizing 5 very high-risk areas to strengthen security posture against emerging threats.
